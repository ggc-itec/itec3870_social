  shredded lettus, shredded cheese and a dab of sour cream. :yum:

#Game
Just for the record, I love all of my games in their own unique way. However, if I
had to choose "one game to rule them all", I would have to give the edge to 
Knights of the Old Republic. Although it is an older game and the graphics arn't 
as cool as all of these newer games coming out, the storyline more than makes up for
it.
